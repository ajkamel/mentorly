As a strategy for helping people succeed in life, mentoring works to those open to it. It helps give people the confidence, resources and skills they need to reach their potential.

But like any development strategy, mentoring works best when measures are taken to ensure quality and effectiveness. When the tool of change is a close relationship, as is the case with mentoring, everyone involved should proceed with care. The risks and improvements to the person are proportional to how long the relationship endures. The longer a relationship lasts, usually the closer the bond and the greater benefit the mentee.

With Mentorly we hope to bridge the gap and create a medium to facilitate this.

##Brief

Mentorly connects mentors with mentees within an organization, company or group by matching experienced members with members looking for guidance, support and training in a particular field. 

The matching can be based not just around the organization's goals but around the mentor and mentee's interests.

When a member is first introduced to the site they are presented with a short bio on the available mentor's and is prompted to fill out a short profile about their interests.  After this they will be shown a list of mentors to rank in terms of who they think they might want to pair up with.  

After this the mentor would rank the available mentees and select in order of preference who they would like to mentor. 

Once this process is complete the organization would be presented with recommended matches for mentors and mentee groups and allow final approval for Mentoring groups.

Mentors would be able to organize meetup's, schedule events and offer words of advice or wisdom at any given time.

Members would also be able to send mailbox messages to eacher other.
